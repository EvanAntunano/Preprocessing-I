      <h2>Intro</h2>
      <p class="intro-p">
        My name is Evan Antuñano. I currently live in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. My goal is to work with a company to get projects done while working along-side my coworkers. I am more than willing to relocate (would prefer it, actually) and am motivatd to make development my life-long career.

      <h2>Skills</h2>
      <p class="middle-left-p">
        I have experience with full-stack web development, paralegal duties, creating government guidelines in the commercial space sector, and much more! As a paralegal, I worked to help form nonprofits by not only running them through the hurdles, but also: filing forms with the state, drafting all legal statements required, creating all tax and mission statement documents, and making sure they were compliant with federal code.</p>
        <p class="middle-left-p2">As an intern at the FAA AST-3 (Office of Commercial Space Transportation) I was tasked with helping create the rules, regulations, and guidelines for commercial space companies (such as SpaceX) who wish to operate in the United States. In that position I gained experience in drafting lectures, legal guidelines, researching current space-law, helping transform aviation guidelines to commercial space guidelines, visiting and evaluating spaceports, and more.</p>
